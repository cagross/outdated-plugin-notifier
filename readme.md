This WordPress plugin helps WordPress admins ensure their site continues to use plugins that are still maintained, rather than plugins that have been abandoned.  After installing the plugin, on the admin Plugins screen, it willl display specific information about each installed plugin.  Specifically, it will indicate the last time each plugin was updated.  To be even more specific, it will indicate the last time the developer for each plugin released an update for that particular plugin.

The latest stable version can be downloaded in zip format from the official WordPress plugin repo:  https://wordpress.org/plugins/outdated-plugin-notifier/
